Node is a javascript runtime, as javascript is confined to run in a browser, Node allows us to run javascript on the server-side or directly on computers.
Node allows us more functionality than running javascript from a browser:
1. we can read & write files on a computer
2. connect to a database
3. act as a server for content
these are normally tasks handled by a server side programming language, and now we can access this functionality with javascript running through Node.

The Role of Nodejs is to run javascript on the back-end or server side.
Common Node uses :
1. Web Servers - writing server side logic
2. Command Line Tools
3. Video Games
4. Native Apps

once node is installed, we can then access the node REPL(Read, Evaluate, Print and Loop) by opening the terminal and typing 'node';

inside the node REPL we can run basic javascript code the same way we would in a browser console.
